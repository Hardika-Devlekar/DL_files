Even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline. This movie is an early nineties US propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor's like Christopher Walken's good name. I could barely sit through it.\"\n",

Things seemed to happen, but with no explanation of what was causing them or why.

Hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on DVD and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released.<br /><br />edit The movie is now moving closer to its correct rating. Over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9, a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1.'\n",
            "Round-trip:  i [UNK] this movie was getting [UNK] well before it hit the [UNK] and i too didnt have high [UNK] for it i [UNK] it was another you got [UNK] type of movie with some nice dance [UNK] and [UNK] acting i was at the theater and [UNK] between this and meet the [UNK] and [UNK] this to my surprise the acting wasnt bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good the fact that it has a [UNK] rating than you got [UNK] is absolutely ridiculous instead of [UNK] to the [UNK] [UNK] on here i recommend going to see a [UNK] showing of this movie so you dont [UNK] too much i think you will be [UNK] surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it when it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far [UNK] acting than many of the other ones go see the movie and [UNK] for yourself [UNK] the rating will [UNK] after it comes out on dvd and more people check the movie out instead of [UNK] it based on comments before the movie [UNK] br [UNK] the movie is now moving [UNK] to its [UNK] rating over [UNK] people have given it a rating of [UNK] a bit too high but at least it is [UNK] to [UNK] the ridiculous [UNK] of 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
